this is a mobile application created with kotlin java
all you need to run this app is android studio or visual studio code 
configure you code editor and download the dependencies appropriatly in your sdk manager and create a virtual machine where you're going to run the app or link your mobile device to the code editor so you can run the app on it
if there's any suggestions i'm open to it
ps : this is my first mobile app
